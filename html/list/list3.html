      <p>For a list to be valid, it must have both parent elements (a set of ul elements or a set of ol elements) and child elements (declared inside of these tags using the li element), and any other content elements are invalid.</p>
      <p>Although some non-content elements such as script, template, style, meta, link, map, area, and datalist are permitted within lists, content elements other than li are not permitted.</p>
